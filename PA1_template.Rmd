activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", quote="\"", comment.char="", colClasses=c("numeric","Date","numeric"))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r steps_by_day}
# steps_by_day <- with(activity,rowsum(steps, factor(date), na.rm=T))

suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))

by_day <- group_by(activity, date) %>%
    summarize(steps = sum(steps, na.rm=T))

ggplot(by_day, aes(by_day$steps)) + geom_histogram()
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
